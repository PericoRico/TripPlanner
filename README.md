## Description

The Trip Planner API allows users to search for trips from a specified origin to a destination and sort the results based on two available strategies: fastest or cheapest. This provides flexibility in choosing the best option based on either the shortest travel duration or the lowest cost.

The API integrates with a 3rd party service to fetch trip data, using the following endpoint: https://xxx.amazonaws.com/default/trips
Requests to the API must include an authentication key using the header x-api-key.

Swagger documentation with the main application details is available at: http://localhost:3000/api

When you open Swagger in the browser, youâ€™ll see an Authorize button in the top right corner.

Click Authorize, enter the API key from your .env file, and Swagger will automatically include this key in the x-api-key header for all requests made from the Swagger interface.

## Installation


Requirements: 

- node 20.18


Install node modules:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

Before running the app, ensure that all required environment variables are set correctly. 
You can do this by creating a `.env` file in the root directory based on `.env.example`. This file includes all necessary variables the application needs to function properly.
Ensure that you are passing the provided API key as a 'x-api-key' header.

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```


## Test

Unit test are defined for the trips controller and service. 
E2e test are written for validation purposes.

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

```

## Notes

## Saving and deliting trips

In this exercise, the implemented API allows any user to save or delete trip entries without specific user restrictions or ownership verification. This approach meets the exercise requirements but may not reflect typical production standards, where strict access controls would likely be in place. In a production-ready application, each trip entry would ideally be linked to a unique user identifier, with appropriate authorization measures to ensure only the owner of a trip entry can modify or delete it.

This design is intended solely for demonstration purposes and should not be assumed as secure or privacy-compliant for production environments.

## Extras, 

### Stopover trips

THe type of these kind of trip has been determined by the first leg of the trip. This may not be fully correct since the trip would possible be a combination of transports.
